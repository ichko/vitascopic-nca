Defining life is outside of the scope of this project, but most will agree: Life is symbiogenetic, low-entropic patterns that are robust to changes in their environment. This is true for bacteria, cells and elephants.  

This project is about the automatic search for patterns of this kind, which is why we are presenting: The _VitaScope™_.

An ascii-schematic of the processe can be seen here:

[u] -> [generator + noise] -> [decoder] -> [u_hat].

Where the generator can be any interesting process, but in out case is a Neural Cellular Automata.

Starting from an initial condition, the noise is applied at **TBD**, resulting in spatio-temporally robust patterns.

The decoder is translationally invariant, neither encourating nor discouraging dynamically moving solutions.

Finally, u_hat is compared to u through simple MSE. 




TODO:
Maybe make decoder rotationally invariant?

Okay, so what about noise in a radius, to make it interactive
